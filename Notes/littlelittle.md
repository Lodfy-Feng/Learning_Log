Because WSL2(Debian) is using the conhost.exe instead of Windows terminal, so I need to turn on the CRTL-shift-v button function manually by the property selection of title bar and click on the Option tab, then find and tick this function
down the page, then we can get this shorcut working
As for the browser function, I learned about tab group which is especially useful when I use it to do the purpose-aimed browsing activity.
